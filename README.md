# BTIPFlow
A package to make the analysis of flow data easier.

I have included a test dataset that contains several flow samples (it is a flowset) that can be used to test the code. 

This will hopefully automate most flow cytometry experiments. For your particular experiment, you can tweak the code found in the "example" vignette.

You can install with 

```{R}
devtools::install_github("jonesnoaht/BTIPFlow")
```

## Notes

This provides some excellent information about versioning. https://r-pkgs.org/release.html

## Progress

I have completed the first version of this package.
